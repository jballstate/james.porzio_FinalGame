1. must have sound file in same directory as game file

2. must have pygame installed


My project goals are to create a text based magic genie game that grants your wishes which uses pygame to use sound effects as well.

The instructions are listed above

I used python and pygame to create this game

I did not use any external resources because I recorded the sounds myself 

I learned a lot from this project through trial and error.  I learned a lot about debugging and how to import sound files into games.  

I got stuck trying to figure out why my sound file wouldn't play but then I realized it was in an unreadable format. 

I would like to improve the variations of responses from the genie.  

I would do things differently by creating more different responses and maybe more sound effects.  

I did not stray far from the game design document everything was almost spot on. 

I stayed on track by following each step in the game design document to the best of my ability.
